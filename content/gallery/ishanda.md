### What I Did in Teamwork

i山大小程序主要在三个方面进行优化，一个是对重构框架，一个是对性能方面进行适当的优化，另一个是对查课表、校车查询、咨询速览等功能进行编写与更新。i山大小程序通过此次更新与底层优化，开发流程能够对开发者团队更加的友好，更利于后期维护以及开发，统一开发流程与开发规范，并且随着功能与性能的不断提升，i山大小程序在学子手中使用能够更加的频繁，i山大小程序也能不断得到提升与优化，从而能够更加促进学子在学校的生活与学习。

The i-mountain program is optimized in three aspects, one is to refactor the framework, the other is to optimize the performance appropriately, and the other is to write and update functions such as checking the timetable, school bus query, and quick consultation.
